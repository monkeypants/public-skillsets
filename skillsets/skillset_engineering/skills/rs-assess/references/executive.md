# Skillset Quality Assessment

Evaluating whether a consulting skillset is fit for its current
purpose. Combines agent-autonomous structural verification with
human-sourced operational and situational signal. Assessment
produces evaluable fitness functions, not abstract maturity ratings.

**Domain**: Practice engineering — skillset fitness evaluation
**Produces**: Prioritised findings with fitness functions and
  selected refinement strategies
**Key insight**: Assessment requires distinct information sources
  per dimension — structural properties are agent-verifiable,
  but fitness, methodology, and operational quality require the
  human as primary signal source, not as approver of agent output.

## Pipeline Coherence Criteria

Seven general criteria for evaluating any skillset's pipeline:

| # | Criterion | Question |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Decision point validity | Genuine human decision at each gate? |
| 2 | Information timing | Human has what they need to decide? |
| 3 | Human leverage | Using human-unique capabilities? |
| 4 | Cycle time proportionality | Ceremony proportional to risk and reversibility? |
| 5 | Situational fit | Pipeline serves current users/context? |
| 6 | Feedback integration | Later-stage insights can flow back? |
| 7 | Vertical completability | Single issue can go from identification to fix? |
