## Notes for agents

- Each segment must be genuinely distinct in at least one of: needs,
  channels, relationship type, or willingness to pay.
- Value propositions are from the customer's perspective: "Reduced
  operational cost" not "We provide cost-effective solutions."
- If a value proposition serves multiple segments identically, note the
  overlap. This may indicate the segments should be merged, or it may
  indicate a platform dynamic.
- Confidence notes should reference specific research sub-reports.
