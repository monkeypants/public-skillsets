# Business Model Canvas Overview

The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic management tool for
developing new or documenting existing business models. It was
developed by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur and published in
*Business Model Generation* (2010).

## The nine building blocks

### 1. Customer Segments

The different groups of people or organisations an enterprise aims to
reach and serve. Questions to ask:
- For whom are we creating value?
- Who are our most important customers?
- Mass market, niche, segmented, diversified, or multi-sided?

### 2. Value Propositions

The bundle of products and services that create value for a specific
customer segment. Questions to ask:
- What value do we deliver to the customer?
- Which customer problems are we helping to solve?
- What bundles of products/services are offered to each segment?

### 3. Channels

How a company communicates with and reaches its customer segments to
deliver value. Questions to ask:
- Through which channels do our segments want to be reached?
- How are we reaching them now?
- Which channels work best? Which are most cost-efficient?

### 4. Customer Relationships

The types of relationships a company establishes with specific customer
segments. Questions to ask:
- What type of relationship does each segment expect?
- Which have we established?
- How costly are they? How are they integrated?

### 5. Revenue Streams

The cash a company generates from each customer segment. Questions to ask:
- For what value are our customers willing to pay?
- For what do they currently pay?
- How would they prefer to pay?

### 6. Key Resources

The most important assets required to make a business model work.
Categories: physical, intellectual, human, financial. Questions to ask:
- What key resources do our value propositions require?
- Our distribution channels? Customer relationships? Revenue streams?

### 7. Key Activities

The most important things a company must do to make its business model
work. Categories: production, problem-solving, platform/network.
Questions to ask:
- What key activities do our value propositions require?
- Our distribution channels? Customer relationships? Revenue streams?

### 8. Key Partnerships

The network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work.
Types: strategic alliances, coopetition, joint ventures, buyer-supplier.
Questions to ask:
- Who are our key partners and suppliers?
- Which key resources do we acquire from partners?
- Which key activities do partners perform?

### 9. Cost Structure

All costs incurred to operate a business model. Questions to ask:
- What are the most important costs inherent in our business model?
- Which key resources are most expensive?
- Which key activities are most expensive?
- Cost-driven or value-driven?

## How BMC relates to other frameworks

### Wardley Mapping

A completed Wardley Map can directly inform:
- **Key Resources**: the component inventory provides a grounded list
  of assets and capabilities
- **Key Activities**: the supply chain identifies what the organisation
  actually does to deliver value
- **Key Partnerships**: dependencies on external services map to
  partnership requirements

### SWOT, Porter's Five Forces

BMC is complementary. It describes the business model structure; other
frameworks analyse its competitive position. Research gathered for one
can inform the other.
