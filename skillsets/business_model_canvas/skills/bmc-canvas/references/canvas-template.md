## Notes for agents

- Every cell in the canvas should trace to evidence. "We think they
  use social media" is not evidence. "From `products-services.md`:
  'Company X maintains active accounts on LinkedIn and Twitter with
  combined 500K followers'" is evidence.
- Tensions between blocks are insights, not errors. A cost-driven
  structure with a value-driven value proposition is a tension worth
  discussing, not a mistake to fix.
- The canvas is a snapshot. Note where the model appears to be
  changing or where the client has expressed intent to change.
