# User Needs — {Organisation Name}

## Overview

Brief context: what this organisation does, who it serves, and the scope
of this mapping engagement.

## Users

### 1. {User Class Name}

**Who they are**: {One sentence description — role, relationship to the
organisation}

**Needs**:
1. **{Need name}** — {One sentence description of what they need and why}
2. **{Need name}** — {description}
3. ...

**Evidence**: {References to research sub-reports supporting these needs}

### 2. {User Class Name}

...

## Shared Needs

Needs that appear across multiple user classes:
- **{Need name}** — shared by: {User Class 1}, {User Class 2}

## Excluded / Out of Scope

Users or needs considered but excluded from this engagement, with reasoning:
- {User class or need} — {why excluded}

## Open Questions

- {Question requiring client input}
- {Question requiring client input}

## Notes for agents

- Keep need descriptions from the user's perspective, not the organisation's.
  "Reliable cargo transport" not "Provide reliable cargo transport."
- Each need should be independently meaningful — avoid decomposing too
  finely at this stage. Supply chain decomposition happens in stage 3.
- Shared needs are important signals — they often indicate high-visibility
  components in the eventual map.
- Open questions should be genuine uncertainties, not rhetorical. They
  prompt client discussion.
